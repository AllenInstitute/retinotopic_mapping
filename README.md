This package contains a code base for visual area auto-segmentation of mouse visual cortex by doing 
visual sign map analysis from retinotopic maps. This analysis routine was modified from Garrett et al.,
2014 (1), which was inspired by the earlier work in primate visual system (4, 5). 


The analysis takes visual altitude and azimuth maps of mouse cortex as inputs, calculates the visual 
sign of each pixel and auto-segments the cortical surface into primary visual cortex and multiple higher
visual cortices. Ideally, the visual altitude and azimuth maps can be generated by fourier analysis of
population cortical responses to periodic sweeping checker board visual stimuli (2, 3). But the code of 
this type of visual stimulation and altitude/azimuth retinotopic map generation is not included in this 
package.

The package also provides some useful plotting functions to visualize the results.

Please check the jupyter notebook in the '\examples' folder for the usage.

#### Issues:

1. Most image analysis parameters are defined as number of pixels, not microns.
2. Works in windows, but not fully tested on Mac and Linux.
